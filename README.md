Hide/Show window app hotkey: `Cmd+Option+Shift+T` or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T` (Windows)

I strongly recommend that you add a redefinition of the hide/show program hotkeys by one key. You can do this using the [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) program. Here's an article to help you.: <https://alfa-brain.com/blog/17ce8147-6d4a-469d-ac1b-cc0bfa67590a>

For Windows users, you can use [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) as an alternative to Karabiner. It allows powerful key remapping and scripting.
